## Task Description

Write a program to calculate the number of leaf nodes in a binary search tree.

**A leaf node refers to a node that does not have any child nodes. In other words, leaf nodes are the lowest nodes in the tree, and they do not have either a left or a right subtree.**

You can use the command "wget http://140.113.150.142/src/11259/11259.c" to download the example program. You just need to complete the function **int countLeaf(TreeNode *root)** in the example code.

## Input Format
10 integers representing the values of 10 nodes in a binary search tree.

## Output Format
An integer representing the count of leaf nodes in the binary search tree.
